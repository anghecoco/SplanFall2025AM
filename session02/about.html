    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
   <P>Neoboletus luridiformis, also previously known as Boletus luridiformis and (invalidly) as Boletus erythropus, is a fungus of the bolete family, most of which produce mushrooms with tubes and pores beneath their caps. It is commonly known as the scarletina bolete, for its red pores, which are yellow when young. Other common names include the red foot bolete, dotted stemmed bolete, or dotted stem bolete.[1]</P>

<p>It is found in Northern Europe and North America. While edible when cooked properly, it can cause vomiting and diarrhea if not. Where the two species coincide, it can be confused with species such as Rubroboletus satanas.</P>
   <h3>TAXONOMY</h3>
    <p>In 1796 Christian Hendrik Persoon described Boletus erythropus, deriving its specific name from the Greek ερυθρος ("red") and πους ("foot"),[2] referring to its red-coloured stalk. During the next 200 years or so, this name was used extensively for the species which is the subject of this article, and which (as well as a red stalk) has red pores.[3] Recently it was discovered however that Persoon's mushroom had orange pores, and was a different species (actually thought to be Suillellus queletii),[4][5] so the use of this name for the red-pored mushroom was invalid.[4][6]</p>
